Chou doufu

(Makes one serving)

Ingredients

4 slices of firm tofu marinated in fermented milk (found at the tofu counter at Carrefour)
3 cups vegetable oil (enough to have 1 inch of oil in your wok)
1 tbs soybean paste
1 tbs chili sauce, or dried chili flakes
Method

Heat wok over a high flame
Add the vegetable oil
When the oil is hot enough that a splash of water or flour causes it to sizzle, it’s frying time
Carefully place the tofu slices into the oil, and gently stir to make sure they don’t stick together
Let fry, stirring occasionally, for two minutes (it will start to smell!)
When the bottoms are browned a bit, flip over and let fry for two to three more minutes, until a really nice golden and crispy crust is formed
Drain on a plate with paper towels
Place the pieces on a serving dish and top with the soybean paste and chili sauce
Serve immediately
Disclaimer: They don’t call this stuff “stinky tofu” for nothing -- your apartment will stink.
